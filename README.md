# youtube-bot
This bot is created to exploit selenium's power and login, search, and get a substantial number of http links and go through them to comment in each of the videos. 
To say in the details, this is my first bot project, and uses many of the selenium features, i.e. finding elements, finding links, webdriver functions, such as click, sendkeys etc. This can be also used to comment in large scale in a lot of videos. 
This bot is currently semi-autonomous. you have to run the file yourself, as well as you have to zoom out to 25% in the firefox window it opens.
In a intel core i5 pc of hp, it takes approximately 4-5 minutes to work on each loops. It currently comments twice in each video, which I have let stay, but one can take a list of the set of the hrefs, thus deleting identical copies. 
Hope it helps someone to start with selenium, see errors like noelementreference, staleelementreference, elementnotinteractive etc errors, and possibly understand solutions to this.
